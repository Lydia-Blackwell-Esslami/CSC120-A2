Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I don't get why we have a separate file for the computer class and the ship class. In my opinion the entire thing should be done in one file so there's no need to have to use an import statement to make it work, which creates unnessecary complications. Also the instructions were not really clear, probably because the day the assignment was supposed to be explained class was canceled due to the snow. Additionally due to life circumstances I didn't really have time to work on this properly and by the time I did start working it I didn't really have any motivation or interest in it, so I have not done a very good job here.
